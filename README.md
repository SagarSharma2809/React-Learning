# React-Learning 

This is a compilation of all the React components that I have created as a part of my learning process.

## Components Made So Far:
1. Clicker - learned states in React.
2. ShoeList - mapping of lists, props.
3. Toggler Component - practicing states in React.
4. Rubix cube Component - practicing states in React.
5. Find your Wallpaper - built with useEffect Hook in react and save-as npm package
