# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is a compilation of all the React components that I have created as a part of my learning process.

## Components Made So Far:
1. Clicker - learned states in React.
2. ShoeList - mapping of lists, props.
3. Toggler Component - practicing states in React.
4. Rubix cube Component - practicing states in React.
5. Find your Wallpaper - built with useEffect Hook in react and save-as npm package
